Unlock full potential of your placement! With this mod you can place seeds, walls, ground and tiles in grids and lines!

List of features:<br/>
- Place almost any item in grids of 2x2 up to 7x7. To increase grid size use `Numpad +` and `Numpad -` buttons.
- Place almost any item in lines with length of 2 up to 7. To toggle between placement modes use `C` button.
- Select belts, drills or mechanical arms placement direction before placing anything! Use `V` button to select their rotation. When placing in lines mode select changes direction pattern instead of axis. Hold `Ctrl` to use vanilla placement logic with 1x1 place mode.
- Change Paint Brush color with a key (By default `V`)

All Keybinds are rebindable in the options menu!<br/>
