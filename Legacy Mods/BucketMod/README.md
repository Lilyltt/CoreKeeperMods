# Bucket Mod
Store and transfer liquids using buckets!

This mod adds two new items:
- Bucket: can store 1 liter of any liquid.
- Pressurized Can: can store 5 liters of any liquid.

Note: vanilla now also has a bucket. Contents of this mod persist in case you want to keep using it.

More features might come in the future. If you have any feature you would like to see added, message me on Discord
