# Infinite Ore Boulder Updated

Mine your ore boulders until the end of time and even further!

This mod makes all ore boulders infinite. This is done by constantly refilling their health. 

If you want any ore boulder removed you will either need to remove the mod and mine it to deplition, or destory it using cheats.

Mod originally created by `wu452148993`, updated version was rewritten from scratch.
