# Secure Attachment

Don't let your enemies destroy your carefully built traps with ease!

With this mod certain structures, like robot arms, drill, etc. will become indestructible. To remove them you must use your trusty wrench, which can be found in wrench workbench.
Wrench workbench can be found in the root workbench

Other mods can also add their own wrenches and make their objects mounted. To do that use `WrenchCDAuthroing` and `MountedCDAuthoring` components

More features might come in the future. If you have any feature you would like to see added, message me on Discord
